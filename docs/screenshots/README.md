# README screenshots

From the repository root, after installing the application's dependencies:

```sh
cd docs/screenshots && npm ci && npx playwright install chromium && npm run capture
```

Requires Node.js, Python 3 for static previews, and `cwebp` (libwebp).
Each capture starts and stops its own loopback preview. It uses a fresh browser,
fixture data, a fixed date, and a 1440 × 960 viewport. External requests are blocked;
any mocked responses are defined in `capture.mjs`. The images show the actual UI,
not proof of backend or provider behavior. Images are WebP, below 300 KB.

Application runtime dependencies are unchanged by this separate tooling package.

The capture mocks the Tauri command bridge. Native file import and Rust checks
remain separate from this frontend preview.
